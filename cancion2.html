    I know sleep is friends with death<br>
But maybe I should get some rest<br>
'Cause I've been out here workin' all damn day<br>
Blueberries and butterflies<br>
The pretty things that greet my eyes<br>
When you call and I say: I'm on my way<br>
<p></p>
(One, two)<br>

You and me belong together<br>
Like cold iced tea and warmer weather<br>
Where we lay out late underneath the pines<br>
And we still have fun when the Sun won't shine<br>
You and me belong together all the time<br>
<p></p><br>
(Mmm, mmm, mmm)<br>
(Oh, woah)<br>
<p></p>
Spillin' wine and homemade drinks<br>
We throw a cheers, the worries sink<br>
Damnit, it's so good to be alive (wow)<br>
We know that we don't got much<br>
But, then again, it's just enough<br>
To always find a way for a good time<br>
<p></p>
You and me belong together<br>
Like cold iced tea and warmer weather<br>
Where we lay out late underneath the pines<br>
And we still have fun when the Sun won't shine<br>
You and me belong together<br>
<p></p>
This love is all we need<br>
Oh, we've got so much<br>
You and me, oh<br>
<p></p>
You and me belong together<br>
Like cold iced tea and warmer weather<br>
Where we lay out late underneath the pines<br>
And we still have fun when the Sun won't shine<br>
You and me belong together all the time<br>
<p></p>
It goes on and on and on (hey)<br>
It goes on and on and on (hahaha)<br>
It goes on and on and on (woo)<br>
