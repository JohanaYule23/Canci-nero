    Nah, nah, nah<br>
    <p></p>
    Oh, no<br>
See you walking 'round like it's a funeral<br>
Not so serious, girl, why those feet cold?<br>
We just getting started, don't you tiptoe<br>
Tiptoe, ah<br>
<p></p>
Waste time with a masterpiece<br>
Don't waste time with a masterpiece<br>
You should be rolling with me<br>
You should be rolling with me, ah<br>
<p></p>
You're a real-life fantasy<br>
You're a real-life fantasy<br>
But you're moving so carefully<br>
Let's start living dangerously<br>
<p></p>
Talk to me, baby<br>
I'm going blind from this sweet, sweet craving, whoa, oh<br>
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy<br>
I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean<br>
<p></p>
Walk for me, baby<br>
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa, oh<br>
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy<br>
I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean<br>
<p></p>
Goddamn<br>
See you licking frosting from your own hands<br>
Want another taste, I'm begging: Yes, ma'am<br>
I'm tired of all this candy on the dry land<br>
Dry land, oh<br>
<p></p>
Waste time with a masterpiece<br>
Don't waste time with a masterpiece<br>
You should be rolling with me<br>
You should be rolling with me, ah<br>
<p></p>
You're a real-life fantasy<br>

Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy<br>
I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean (yeah, yeah)<br>
